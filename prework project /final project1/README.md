# Landing Page Project

This project was implemented by Ibrahim Alsaidi as part of the Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree program. It implements a basic landing page with a fixed navigation menu that dynamically updates as the user scrolls through the page. The navigation menu is built dynamically using JavaScript based on the contents of the sections on the page. Clicking on a menu item causes the page to smoothly scroll to the corresponding section. Additionally, as the user scrolls through the page, the currently active section is highlighted in the navigation menu.

## Usage

To use the landing page, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You can then scroll through the page and click on the navigation menu items to navigate to the different sections.

## Files

- `index.html` - the main HTML file that defines the structure of the landing page
- `css/styles.css` - the stylesheet that defines the styles for the landing page
- `js/app.js` - the JavaScript file that implements the dynamic navigation menu and scrolling functionality
- `README.md` - this file
